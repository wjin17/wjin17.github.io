This is where I document the process behind the projects I’m working on — a mix of web development, machine learning, and everything in between. I get excited about learning new things related to these topics so I end up bouncing between a lot of different ideas and projects. This is a nice way to keep it all together and serve as a reference for me and anyone else who might be trying to do the same thing.
