I have a great idea for a new project! Alright, let's make a new directory and set everything up. The first step is to install Typescript. Nice... wait hold on... I need to setup my tsconfig. What's the difference between esm and cjs? Why are there so many rules? 

I've had this dialog with myself so many times and I've had it. So here's a list of templates and a short guide on how to use it.

## Installation guide

Each branch is a separate template. Use the following command to clone the one you want into a target directory.

```bash
git clone -b <template> git@github.com:wjin17/ts-templates.git <your_project>
```

## Templates

Templates will be preset with a tsconfig, eslint rules, jest for unit and integration tests, and a basic project structure.

### Base

This is the most basic example. It's useful for running scripts or making small libraries.

```bash
git clone -b base https://github.com/wjin17/ts-templates/tree/base <your_project>
```

### Express + React Monorepo

A basic React frontend with an Express backend all in a monorepo.

```bash
git clone -b express-react https://github.com/wjin17/ts-templates/tree/base <your_project>
```

### Express + Htmx Monorepo

Uses HTMX and SSE for chatting with an Express backend

```bash
git clone -b htmx https://github.com/wjin17/ts-templates/tree/base <your_project>
```
